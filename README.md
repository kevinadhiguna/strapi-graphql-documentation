  <h2>Strapi GraphQL API - queries & mutations</h2>
</div>
<br>

Hello there, welcome to Strapi GraphQL API documentation! This contains some of queries and mutations that hopefully helps you if you are using GraphQL API in your Strapi project :)

## ¬ÆÔ∏è Register
Just like any other applications that requires you to create an account, you have to sign up first to create a user in `users` collection type that comes default in Strapi. Here is how to register an account :
```
mutation Register($input: UsersPermissionsRegisterInput!) {
  register(input: $input) {
    jwt
    user {
      username
      email
    }
  }
}
```

Next, put your `username`, `email`, and `password` as variables :
```
{
  "input": {
    "username": "YOUR_USERNAME",
    "email": "YOUR_EMAIL",
    "password": "YOUR_PASSWORD"
  }
}
```
Finally, a JWT shows in response.

## üîí Login
```
mutation Login($input: UsersPermissionsLoginInput!) {
  login(input: $input) {
    jwt
    user {
      username
      email
      confirmed
      blocked
      role {
        id
        name
        description
        type
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Then enter your `identifier` and `password` as variables :
```
{
  "input": {
    "identifier": "YOUR_USERNAME OR YOUR EMAIL",
    "password": "YOUR_PASSWORD"
  }
}
```
Eventually, you will get JWT in response.

## üôã Me Query

To identify current user, you can use `me` query, like this :
```
query MeQuery {
  me {
    id
    username
    email
    confirmed
    blocked
    role {
      id
      name
      description
      type
    }
  }
}
```
<b>Note : `me` query requires JWT attached in headers!</b>

### üìé How to attach JWT in headers :
`authorization : Bearer YOUR_TOKEN`

## üÜï Create a User in Users (a collection type that comes default in Strapi app)
>What? Create a User? Did I just create a User using `Registration` mutation above?

Sure, here is some notable points :
|                                            |                `Create User` mutation                |                                   `Registration` mutation                                   |
|:------------------------------------------:|:----------------------------------------------------:|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|
|       Needs JWT attached in Headers?       | Yes, usually you must be `superadmin` role in Strapi |                                              No                                             |
| Is created user `authenticated` initially? |                          No                          | Yes, users that are created with `Registration` mutation is already authenticated initially |

```
mutation CreateUser($input: createUserInput) {
  createUser(input: $input) {
    user {
      id
      createdAt
      updatedAt
      username
      email
      provider
      confirmed
      blocked
      role {
        id
        name
        description
        type
        permissions {
          type
          controller
          action
          enabled
          policy
          role {
            name
          }
        }
        users {
          username
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Pass these variables :
```
{
  "input": {
    "data": {
      "username": "YOUR_USERNAME",
      "email": "YOUR_EMAIL",
      "password": "YOUR_PASSWORD"
    }
  }
}
```
<b>Note : Please attach a JWT in Headers, usually Superadmin's JWT.</b>

### üîë How to get Superadmin's JWT

Go to `Documentation` in the menu on the left side -> Copy the token in `Retrieve your jwt token`.

## üßë Retrieve/Fetch a single User

Previously, we created a new user. To retrieve a specific user inside User collection type, you can make use of this query :
```
query FetchSingleUser($id: ID!) {
  user(id: $id) {
    id
    createdAt
    updatedAt
    username
    email
    provider
    confirmed
    blocked
    role {
      name
    }
  }
}
```

Variables :
```
{
  "id": "YOUR_USER_ID"
}
```

## üë• Retrieve/Fetch all Users

If you want to get all users in your Strapi app, this is the query you are looking for : 
```
query FetchUsers {
  users {
    id
    createdAt
    updatedAt
    username
    email
    provider
    confirmed
    blocked
    role {
      name
    }
  }
}
```

You do not have to pass any variables but you may need to attach JWT in your headers (depends on your Strapi app's roles & permissions).

## üîÑ Update a User

Imagine you want to change a user's email. To do such things, you should use a mutation which updates the user's data. Here is an example to change a user's email :
```
mutation UpdateUser($input: updateUserInput) {
  updateUser(input: $input) {
    user {
      id
      createdAt
      updatedAt
      username
      email
      provider
      confirmed
      blocked
      role {
        name
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Then pass some variabes that you would like to change (in this case, `email` field) :
```
{
  "input": {
    "where": {
      "id": "YOUR_USER_ID"
    },
    "data": {
      "email": "YOUR_USER_EMAIL"
    } 
  }
}
```

If you want to change fields other than `email`, just replace the `email` variable.

## ‚ùå Delete/Remove a User

>A user decided to no longer use my app. How do I remove him/her?

Here is a mutation that might do the task :
```
mutation deleteUser($input: deleteUserInput) {
  deleteUser(input: $input) {
    user {
      id
      createdAt
      updatedAt
      username
      email
      provider
      confirmed
      blocked
      role {
        name
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Place the user ID of the user you want to remove as a variable :
```
{
  "input": {
    "where": {
      "id": "YOUR_USER_ID"
    }
  }
}
```

<b>Note : Please carefully control which roles are able to conduct `delete` operation as it is sensitive.</b>

## üÜï Create an Entry in a Collection Type

Suppose you have created a collection type named `idCardVerification`. Here is how you can add a new record inside it :
```
mutation createIdCardVerification($input: createIdCardVerificationInput) {
  createIdCardVerification(input: $input) {
    idCardVerification {
      id
      identifier
      birthPlace
    }
  }
}

```

For instace, `identifier` and `birthPlace` are variables available in `idCardVerification` collection type. Here are variables you should pass :
```
{
  "input": {
    "data": {
      "identifier": "YOUR_USERNAME OR YOUR_EMAIL",
      "birthPlace": "London, United Kingdom"
    }
  }
}
```

<b>Note : `birthPlace: London, United Kingdom` is just an example to fill a field</b>

## üìÆ Fetch/Retrieve a single entry in collection type

To fetch an entry in your collection type, this query is probably able help you :
```
query FetchSingleIdCardVerification($id: ID!) {
  idCardVerification(id: $id) {
    id
    identifier
    birthPlace
  }
}
```

Pass the ID of the record/entry you want to fetch :
```
{
  "id": "ID_OF_ENTRY"
}
```

## üìí Fetch/Retrieve all entries in collection type

This may get you all of the entries in your collection type :
```
query FetchIdCardVerifications {
  idCardVerifications {
    id
    identifier
    birthPlace
  }
}
```

## üîÑ Update an entry in collection type

```
mutation UpdateIdCardVerification($input: updateIdCardVerificationInput) {
  updateIdCardVerification(input: $input) {
    idCardVerification {
      id
      kind
      identifier
      birthPlace
    }
  }
}
```

You want to change `birthPlace` value to California, United States. Pass these in variables :
```
{
  "input": {
    "where": {
      "id": "ID_OF_ENTRY"
    },
    "data": {
      "birthPlace": "California, United States"
    }
  }
}
```

You are changing `birthPlace` field. The response should display `birthPlace` field with the updated value.

## ‚ùå Delete/Remove an entry in collection type

```
mutation deleteIdCardVerification($input: deleteIdCardVerificationInput) {
  deleteIdCardVerification(input: $input) {
    idCardVerification {
      id
      identifier
      birthPlace
    }
  }
}
```

Variables :
```
{
  "input": {
    "where": {
      "id": "ID_OF_ENTRY"
    }
  }
}
```

## üì§ üñºÔ∏è Upload a single image

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning : Currently Strapi's GraphQL Playground does not support file/image upload. You cn use other GraphQL client to test your GraphQL upload mutation.
One of the GraphQL clients I use is Altair. You can download it here : https://altair.sirmuel.design/#download

Please create a new entry in your collection type API first ! Otherwise this will not be attached to your entry.
Note : the `refId` is the ID of the entry you create in your collection type API.
```
mutation SingleImageUpload($refId: ID, $ref: String, $field: String, $file: Upload!) {
  upload(refId: $refId, ref: $ref, field: $field, file: $file) {
    id
    createdAt
    updatedAt
    name
    alternativeText
    caption
    width
    height
    formats
    hash
    ext
    mime
    size
    url
  }
}
```

Variables :
```
{
  "refId": "ID_OF_YOUR_ENTRY_IN_YOUR_COLLECTION_TYPE",
  "ref": "YOUR_COLLECTION_TYPE_NAME",
  "field": "FIELD_NAME"
}
```

## üì§ üñºÔ∏è Upload multiple images in a single field
```
mutation MultipleImageUpload(
  $refId: ID
  $ref: String
  $field: String
  $files: [Upload]!
) {
  multipleUpload(refId: $refId, ref: $ref, field: $field, files: $files) {
    id
    createdAt
    updatedAt
    name
    alternativeText
    caption
    width
    height
    formats
    hash
    ext
    mime
    size
    url
  }
}
```

Variables :
```
{
  "refId": "ID_OF_YOUR_ENTRY_IN_YOUR_COLLECTION_TYPE",
  "ref": "YOUR_COLLECTION_TYPE_NAME",
  "field": "FIELD_NAME"
}
```

<b>Note : In this case, I attached images with name `files.0`, `files.1`, ... , `files.n` as variables' names until the number of image you want to upload (n).</b>

## üì§ üñºÔ∏è Upload a single image in separate fields
>Hmm... but how do I upload a single image to several fields in a single request?

All right, imagine you created a collection type which has several fields, including `cardImage`, `facePhoto`, and `personWithCardPhoto`. Otherwise, just replace those fields with yours. Ok, here we go :
```
mutation UploadSingleImageToSeveralFields(
  $ref: String
  $refId: ID
  $cardImage: Upload!
  $facePhoto: Upload!
  $personWithCardPhoto: Upload!
) {
  cardImage: upload(
    ref: $ref
    refId: $refId
    field: "cardImage"
    file: $cardImage
  ) {
    id
    createdAt
    updatedAt
    name
    alternativeText
    caption
    width
    height
    formats
    hash
    ext
    mime
    size
    url
  }
  facePhoto: upload(
    ref: $ref
    refId: $refId
    field: "facePhoto"
    file: $facePhoto
  ) {
    id
    createdAt
    updatedAt
    name
    alternativeText
    caption
    width
    height
    formats
    hash
    ext
    mime
    size
    url
  }
  personWithCardPhoto: upload(
    ref: $ref
    refId: $refId
    field: "personWithCardPhoto"
    file: $personWithCardPhoto
  ) {
    id
    createdAt
    updatedAt
    name
    alternativeText
    caption
    width
    height
    formats
    hash
    ext
    mime
    size
    url
  }
}
```

Variables :
```
{
  "ref": "YOUR_COLLECTION_TYPE_NAME",
  "refId": "ID_OF_YOUR_ENTRY_IN_YOUR_COLLECTION_TYPE"
}
```

<b>Please do not forget to attach your files with variables' names.</b><br>
Note: In this case, the variables' names are `cardImage`, `facePhoto`, and `personWithCardPhoto`.

### üöÄ How does `UploadSingleImageToSeveralFields` mutation work ?

In the `UploadSingleImageToSeveralFields` mutation above, you still need `ref`, `refId`, and field name. However you are sending a request to a collection type and are trying to attach images in a sngle record inside the collection type. So, you are able to set `ref` and `refId` as variables. The field name ? You should name it statically as you want to upload an image in different fields. Hopefully this approach helps :)

## üìÇ Get all files
>All right, I got images and files uploaded to my Strapi app but how do I know what files did I upload ?  

To get all the files uploaded to database within your Strapi app, here is the query :
```
query FetchFiles {
  files {
    id
    createdAt
    updatedAt
    name
    alternativeText
    caption
    width
    height
    formats
    hash
    ext
    mime
    size
    url
  }
}
```

Unfortunately, currently Strapi does not provide a query to fetch a single file.

## üë®‚Äçüíª Fetch a single role

Here is the query to display a single role :
```
query fetchSingleRole($id: ID!) {
  role(id: $id) {
    id
    name
    description
    type
    permissions {
      id
      type
      controller
      action
      enabled
      policy
      role {
        name
      }
    }
    users {
      id
      createdAt
      updatedAt
      username
      email
      provider
      confirmed
      blocked
      role {
        name
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Variable :
```
{
  "id": "ROLE_ID"
}
```

## üë®‚Äçüíª üë®‚Äçüíº üßë‚Äçüîß Fetch all roles

Below is the query to get all roles :
```
query FetchRoles {
  roles {
    id
    name
    description
    type
    permissions {
      id
      type
      controller
      action
      enabled
      policy
      role {
        name
      }
    }
    users {
      id
      createdAt
      updatedAt
      username
      email
      provider
      confirmed
      blocked
      role {
        name
      }
    }
  }
}
```
